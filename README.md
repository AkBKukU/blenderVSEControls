# blenderVSEControls
Add the video controls from the timeline view to the VSE.

## The Problem
I don't need the primary function of the timeline view. Just the frame and
playback controls.

## The Solution
Add those controls to the VSE view.

## Known Problems
This is pretty minor but, the strip preview progress bar moves the controls.
There's nothing I can do about this. You can only append controls to the panel.
